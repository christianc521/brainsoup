concept joint [Parts]
purpose
    connect two or more parts through joint creation
state
    independent, connected
actions
    create (x: Parts)
        when x is independent and valid for joint creation
        - create joint
        - connect x
        - x state becomes connected
    destroy (x: Joint)
        when x is connected
        - destroy joint
        - x state becomes independent
operational principle

concept dowel [Part]
purpose
    create a part for structural support
state
    valid, modified
actions
    create (x: Dowel)
        when x is valid
        - create dowel
    destroy (x: Dowel)
        when x is valid or modified
        - destroy dowel
    scale (x: Dowel, s: number)
        - scale dowel length by s
    rotate (x: Dowel, r: number)
        - rotate dowel by r degrees
    move (x: Dowel, v: Vector3)
        - move dowel by v
    modify (x: Dowel, y: Dowel, j: Joint)
        when j is obstructed by x or y
        - modify dowel
        - x state becomes modified
        - y state becomes modified
    detach (x: Dowel, j: Joint)
        when j is deleted
        - modify dowel to original length
        - x state becomes not modified
